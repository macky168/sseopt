# sseopt
Stochastic Schemata Exploiter-based hyper-parameter optimization of Machine Learning

## Description
Stochastic Schemata Exploiter (SSE) is one of the Evolutionary Algorithms.
SSE-based hyper-parameter optimization method, called SSEopt, has interesting features: quick convergence, the small number of control parameters, and the process visualization.
SSEopt is particularly good at large combinatorial optimization problems in discrete or categorical space.

## Requirement
- numpy 1.19.2
- tensorflow 2.3.0
- pandas 1.2.1

## Usage
